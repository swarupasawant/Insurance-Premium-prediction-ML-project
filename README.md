## üìå Introduction
The goal of this project is to give people an estimate of how much they need based on
their individual health situation. After that, customers can work with any health
insurance carrier and its plans and perks while keeping the projected cost from our
study in mind. This can assist a person to predict the premium of the
personal health insurance.
the website will use that information to generate a premium estimate. Users can use this estimate to compare different insurance options and make a decision on which policy is best for them.
